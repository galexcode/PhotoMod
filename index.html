        <p>My project is called PhotoMod and what I have done is modifying the Instaspam-files to make my own Facebook app where the user can do the same thing but in a more appealing way.</p>

<p>What you can do in the application is upload a photo from your computer than you can edit by rotating, add an overlay from the provided ones or/and add a tint to you picture.
When you have finished editing your photo, then you will be able to post it in your Photos section on Facebook. </p>

<p>The app requires a Facebook account and should be run only on Facebook, even thought you can run it through the webserver too, but for best performance, it should be run through Facebook.</p>

<p>What I have modefied mostly is the index.html and the upload.php where I have added a random and a time functions so the file name is unique, that makes the application usable when more than one person is using it to upload to Facebook.</p>

<p>The application runs on a website and got a unique webadress through Facebook.
The webadress to it is: <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/photomod/">https://apps.facebook.com/photomod/</a></p>
